Quality of an Iteration




Quality of Outcome Determination








Sprint definition

A time box for creating an increment. Each Sprint has a definition of what is to be built, a design and flexible plan that will guide building it, the work, and the resultant product.









Determination of length of sprint.

One month or less. When a Sprint’s horizon is too long the definition of what is being built may change, complexity may rise, and risk may increase. Sprints enable predictability by ensuring inspection and adaptation of progress toward a Sprint Goal at least every calendar month. Sprints also limit risk to one calendar month of cost.










Sprint Rituals
Sprint Planning Meeting
Definition of Done
Product Backlog
Retrospective Commitments
Dev Team (velocity/capacity)
Sprint goals gives direction to the team. Analysis, evaluation, and selection from the Backlog defines Sprint Backlog
Create and actionable plan for delivery.
Ensure the right amount of work is being tackled


Estimation
The act of determining the expected size of something. Helps to set expectations as to the amount of work that can be performed or the length of time until something is finished



   3 types of estimation 			When this occurs 		Unit of measure


Portfolio planning
T-shirt sizes


Product backlog grooming
Story point/ideal days


Sprint planning
Ideal hours/effort-hours





Scrum Roles Involved in Estimation

Planning Poker							 Triangulation

Relate estimates.
Consensus.
Precision.















Ideal day / Ideal hour

Focus on the task; No interruptions. Constantly able to focus, no interruptions


Problems with Ideal estimation

Not accurate. People can’t be 100% focused 100% of the time





Daily Standup
Purpose
The Development Team uses the Daily Stand-up to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and to inspect how progress is trending toward completing the work in the Sprint Backlog
3 Questions


What have you done since the last meeting?

What are you planning to do before the next meeting?

Do you experience any obstacles?
Rules

The Scrum Master asks the questions. Same place and time every day.  For synchronization, not problem-solving. A short meeting may be held after the Scrum meeting to resolve issues (only attended by relevant team members). Time box: 15 minutes daily. It works best if you do it in the early hours of a day. With distributed team: find core hours




Pair Programming

In Pair programming, two developers work together on the code. Both sit at the same computer and create one requirement. They pass the keyboard and mouse back and forth to collaborate. This way they catch errors easily.

Ensure that everyone knows what the code does. Collective code ownership

Two team members work together in single task. Driver and navigator

Constant reflection (real time reviewing).

Reduction of noise.


Sprint Review Meeting
Purpose

A Sprint Review is held at the end of the Sprint to inspect the Increment and adapt the Product Backlog if needed. Intended to be a collaborative meeting between the stakeholders, technical architects, and the Scrum team
