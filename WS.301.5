Definition of Done
Definition
Well understood and well-documented definition of items that must be established to mark a story (or iteration of a project) to be complete. Getting a story to a completed state per the definition of done should be the goal of a team and should be used as the basis for planning.
Assessment/checklist allows work to be defined as “done”
Defined by the development team
Varies per team. Understandable for the team
Helps to define how many items can be selected for the sprint
More mature teams = More stringent criteria
Purpose
Make a team more efficient
Deliver best customer service
Increase sales and profitability
Take advantage of market opportunity
Spur growth
Become more competitive
Getting a story to a completed state as per the definition of done should be the goal of a team and should be used as the basis for planning.


Product Backlog
Definition
The Product Backlog is used to document the wants and needs for “stuff,” which is prioritized by how much value it is to the business. List or requirements that is maintained for the product.
Purpose
Prioritize the value of the business, non-value add or less value add items are eliminated or moved to the bottom of the list. The list is worked based to what the highest priority or value is to the business
Ordering
Worked from high value to low value items. The estimated effort to complete each backlog item is, however, determined by the Development Team. The team contributes by estimating Items and User-Stories, either in Story-points or in estimated hour.
Product Backlog  Grooming
The process of adding/removing items, reordering and re-evaluating the Product backlog
Large Items
Called Epics. Broken down into smaller chunks before being considered for work
PBIs
Product Backlog Item. Each entry item in the backlog



Sprint Backlog
Definition
A list of items pulled from the product backlog chosen based on the estimated amount of work required to complete for the Sprint.The Sprint Backlog is the list of work the Development Team must address during the next sprint.
Purpose
Break the Product Backlog into smaller pieces, promote self-organization of the team
Source of items
Sprint items are taken from the Product backlog
How are items chosen?
Chosen by the development team. They choose from the highest priority value , and they only pull the amount of work that they reasonably think they can accomplish successfully
What does value
orientation vs. results orientation mean?
Value orientation is the idea that the team chooses a sprint backlog based on the highest value tasks. Results orientation is the idea of choosing a Sprint backlog based on how mush work the team reasonably things they can accomplish successfully
Task Board
Interactive listing of work to be/being performed during Sprint.
Used daily to identify workflow.
Displayed in a common work area.
Sprint Backlog Item
Stories/features selected by the development team. Tasks decided by the team to work on during the Sprint



Burndown Chart
Purpose
Provided a daily measure of work remaining in an iteration. Gives a simple view of the sprint progress, Also provides a quick visualization for reference.
How is it updated?
Daily updated/assessed
How often is
it used?
Daily
Significance?
Used for visual reference of progress,

User Stories

Definition
Describes what the user needs  to do in the job function. The who, what, and why of a requirement.


Purpose
Used as basis for requirements gathering.
Users primary way of influencing the functionality of the system to be built


Format
Often written on small notecards
One or more sentences written in everyday business language


Source
Comes from the user. The user basically describes what they need to function


Attributes for completeness

Name
Brief narrative
Acceptance criteria
Any defined conditions




Estimation

Story Points
Choosing enough work to fill up a sprint

Based relative effort
Show only the relative size of the item, not the time to complete it
Teams pick a simple, agreed-upon basis
Used for estimation of activities
Planning Poker
Determining the amount of work for each Product Backlog Item
Based on the Fibonacci Sequence:
Each numbered card represents the amount of work the team member believes this item represents.
Each development team member is issued one set of cards.
If, when hands are shown, there is not a clear agreement on the amount of work involved, high and low bidders will explain why they chose that bid.
(A lot of times, discrepancies happen when a team member forgets about certain tasks that need done so they bid too low, or another overestimates the number of tasks that actually need done and they bid too high.)
The team will vote until they reach a consensus on how much work each task actually is
Fibonacci
Sequence
The Fibonacci sequence is a type of series where each number is the sum of the two that precede it.  1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55.

If one is a 2 and another is a 3, probably should go with a 3 because it's better to give the team more time on a task than not enough. Estimate high.
